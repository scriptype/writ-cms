## Project
- Currently a prototype / PoC phase

## Architecture
- `app/` contains the UI code
- `app/components/` holds reusable components
- Feature-specific modules live in their own folders (e.g., `app/explorePanel/`)

## Preferences
- No 3rd party libraries — vanilla JS only
- No external CSS files — styles are inline `<style>` blocks within component templates

Mini Guide on Customising the Design
====================================


Option 1 - Add custom css and js
--------------------------------
The easiest option to get started.

1) Create a folder named 'theme' in the root
2) Create theme/style.css to customize styling
3) Create theme/script.js to sprinkle your custom javascript

You can modularize your css and js by creating multiple files within theme folder



Option 2 - Use handlebars templates
-----------------------------------
Writ compiles into 4 page types:
- Homepage (theme/index.hbs)
- Post (theme/post-text.hbs, theme/post-photo.hbs, or any other post type)
- Subpage (theme/subpage.hbs)
- Category listing page (theme/category.hbs)

And there are many built-in partials that are used within the "primitives" above
to render a page.

In the source code below you will see commented blocks mentioning which partial
is responsible for rendering what. You may choose to make changes to any part
of the rendering tree:

- Create an empty theme/index.hbs and you'll get a blank homepage to build on.
- Or create theme/posts-text.hbs to edit how a text post should render when it's
  listed in homepage or in its category page.

Everything after this comment block is the actual rendered output.
Have fun!
